            <h1>Introduction to Servlets Quiz</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>1. What is the difference between a web server and a web container?</strong><br>
                - Web server: serves static content - files, images, pdfs,
                videos, exactly as they are on the server machine, 
                can't handle behavior like login, data lookups,... 
                and can't save data to the server.<br>
                - Web container: manages servlets, jsp.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>2. What is a servlet?</strong><br>
                - A servlet is a Java class that extends the capabilities of
                        servers that host applications access by means of a
                        request-response programming model.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>3. How do web servers and web containers interact with servlets?</strong><br>
                - When a request comes to the web server, if the server sees
                the request is for a servlet, it passes the request data to the
                servlet container.<br>
                - The servlet container locates the servlet, creates request
                and response objects and passes them to the servlet, and
                returns to the web server the response stream that the
                servlet produces.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>4. Who creates request objects?</strong><br>
                - Servlet container
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>5. What are the states in the servlet lifecycle?</strong><br>
                - Load<br>
                - Create<br>
                - Init<br>
                - Service<br>
                - Destroy<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>6. Who calls init and when?</strong><br>
                - Servlet container calls init after load servlet and instantiate servlet.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>7. Which of init, service, and doGet should you override?</strong><br>
                - doGet
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>8. In what sense are servlets multi-threaded?</strong><br>
                - Each request runs ina separate thread, new thread will be created 
                for every request and call service() on the thread.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>9. What are the implications of this for servlet instance variables? </strong><br>
                - Only have 1 instance of servlet and all thread share instance variables.
